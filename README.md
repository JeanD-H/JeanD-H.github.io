Portfolio

Description
This is a portfolio website with some of my work on it. It has links to the GitHub repos of the projects.

How to Run

To run this website: open the GitHub repo, click on the dropdown named code, select HTTPS, copy the link, paste it into a browser, press enter. The page will load and you will be able to view the site.

Roadmap to Future Improvements

In the future I hope to improve the siteâ€™s functionality and and layout.  I plan to add more content as my coding skills improve.
